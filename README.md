BMI Calculator using Functions and Methods
The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding weight status while taking age into consideration.BMI, more often than not, correlates with total body fat. This means that as the BMI score increases, so does a personâ€™s total body fat.

The formula is  - BMI = (Weight in kilograms) divided by (Height in metres squared).

A normal BMI score is one that falls between 18.5 and 24.9. This indicates that a person is within the normal weight range for his or her height. Screenshot_20221225_015917.png
